## Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare - Overview
**Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare** is the aggregrate of Microsoft's Health and Life Sciences (HLS) industry solutions, encompassing Azure API for FHIR and its full complement of supporting tools - enabling health data interoperability and integration with Microsoft Dynamics MC4H workstreams.

Azure API for FHIR together with FHIR Proxy (OSS) and the supporting suite of tools enable EHR interoperability, legacy health data format conversion, eventing workflows, IoMT connectivity, bulk FHIR data pipelines for research and ML, SMART on FHIR applications, and more.

Applications built on the Dynamics platform (which include Dynamics model-driven apps) make use of Dataverse and can operate without need of making REST API calls directly to Azure API for FHIR. In addition to running Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare solutions, developers can also take advantage of the Dynamics low-code/no-code environment to construct patient or provider-facing solutions/applications that can tap into healthcare data persisted in Azure API for FHIR.

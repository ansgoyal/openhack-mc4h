#  Challenge () - Authentication, Authorization, Consent
Welcome this challenge is focused on the topics of Authentication, Authorization and Consent.

Contoso Healthcare operates businesses that covers multiple segments:

- Provider
- Payor
- Life Sciences

Contoso is looking to increase its ability to add values in all of it businesses and wants to leverage the data and information that may be derived from a consolidated healthcare information store. They are evaluating Microsoft's Healthcare APIs as part of a larger effort to consolidate and analyze the volumes of healthcare data that it maintains.

Protecting these data repositories from malicious actors, both internal and external is a high priority for the Contoso chief executive officer. The Chief Information Office and Chief Information Security officer understand that Authentication, Authorization and Consent are foundational capabilities that must be built into the resulting system.

Your mission is to demonstrate the out of the box and supplemental capabilities that Microsoft Healthcare APIs will enable Contoso to build identity as an effective security boundary. While this is only part of a complete information risk management program, Contoso has made this effort a high priority and a key factor that they will use to determine what cloud services they will partner with to build their solutions.

# Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare OpenHack

## What is the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare OpenHack?
The Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare (MC4H) OpenHack is an opportunity to gain new health data knowledge and learn about Microsoft's solutions for the Health and Life Sciences industry. The OpenHack will initally be held as a live event in online sessions. For those unable to attend the live event, all materials will remain available for self-paced study.

## Who is the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare OpenHack for?
The Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare OpenHack is intended for healthcare systems integrators, software developers, and other professionals in the healthcare IT space. Participants are expected to have a solid foundation in Azure fundamentals, and a working knowledge of the Microsoft Dynamics 365 platform and industry solutions.

## MC4H OpenHack Live Event Overview
If you are registered for the live event, you will be placed on a team and given instructions for how to log in and get started.

Over the course of three days, you and your teammates will work through a series of guided challenges where you'll test your skills building FHIR data workflows using Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare (MC4H) tools and architectures. You will gain exposure to a complete host of MC4H components and get hands on experience deploying and configuring systems capable of production workloads.

The challenges in this OpenHack are designed to give you and your teammates a chance to exercise your health data problem-solving skills in a collaborative environment. To make this a valuable experience for everyone, each team will need to make sure that 

+ All team members can contribute to the team's success
+ Everyone works in areas that provide opportunities to gain new skills (whatever those areas may be for different team members)

In finding solutions to problems together, you and your teammates will help strengthen each other's knowledge. Ideally, you will all get practice in areas that you have less experience in, and in areas where you have more experience, hopefully you will find opportunities to share what you know and bring the team forward.

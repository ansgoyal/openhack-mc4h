Hello and welcome to the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare OpenHack! This OpenHack will initally be held as a live event in online sessions. For those unable to attend the live event, all materials will remain available for self-paced study. 

# What is the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare OpenHack?
The Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare (MC4H) OpenHack is an opportunity to gain new health data knowledge and learn about Microsoft's solutions for the Health and Life Sciences industry.

Structured as a collection of hands-on training modules covering real-world health data use cases, the MC4H OpenHack is designed both as a live instruction event and as a program for self-paced learning.

Whichever setting you prefer (live instruction or self-paced), participating in this OpenHack will give you a better understanding of how MC4H components operate in a production environment.

# Who is the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare OpenHack for?
The Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare OpenHack is intended for healthcare systems integrators, software developers, and other professionals in the healthcare IT space. Participants are expected to have a solid foundation in Azure fundamentals, and a working knowledge of the Microsoft Dynamics 365 platform and industry solutions.

# MC4H OpenHack Live Event Overview
If you are registered for the live event, you will be placed on a team and given instructions for how to log in and get started.

Over the course of three days, you and your teammates will work through a series of guided challenges where you'll test your skills building FHIR data workflows using Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare (MC4H) tools and architectures. You will gain exposure to a complete host of MC4H components and get hands on experience deploying and configuring systems capable of production workloads.

The challenges in this OpenHack are designed to give you and your teammates a chance to exercise your health data problem-solving skills in a collaborative environment. To make this a valuable experience for everyone, each team will need to make sure that 

+ All team members can contribute to the team's success
+ Everyone works in areas that provide opportunities to gain new skills (whatever those areas may be for different team members)

In finding solutions to problems together, you and your teammates will help strengthen each other's knowledge. Ideally, you will all get practice in areas that you have less experience in, and in areas where you have more experience, hopefully you will find opportunities to share what you know and bring the team forward.

For each challenge, there will be a Microsoft Health and Life Sciences Cloud and Data engineer present to lead the session and serve as a coach, providing guidance as needed. Your team will be able to ask questions, and the coach in attendance will be available to provide support. Bear in mind, however, that the coach can only point you in the right direction. The rest will be up to you and your teammates. As you progress through the challenges, the tasks will increase in difficulty, and you will need to be self-sufficient with information from publically available documentation.

Overall, the most important thing in this OpenHack is for you and your teammates to have a valuable, productive experience gaining new skills with Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare solutions. We wish you and your team the best of luck in your MC4H OpenHack journey!

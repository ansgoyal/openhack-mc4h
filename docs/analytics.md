# Introduction 
Data analytics are fundamental to a wide range of disciplines in the Health and Life Sciences (HLS) industry, including clinical trials, medical research, population health, clinical ML model development, 'omics (genomics, metagenomics, etc.), healthcare quality improvement studies, and more. Many of the challenges in this OpenHack will touch on topics related to data analytics, including FHIR data bulk export and anonymization (i.e., de-identification of PHI).

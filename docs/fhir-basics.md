# Introduction 
The healthcare industry is rapidly transforming health data to the emerging standard of [FHIRÂ®](https://hl7.org/fhir/) (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources). FHIR enables a robust, extensible data model with standardized semantics and data exchange that enables all systems using FHIR to work together. 

Transforming your data to FHIR allows you to quickly connect existing data sources such as the electronic health record systems or research databases. FHIR also enables the rapid exchange of data in modern implementations of mobile and web development. Most importantly, FHIR can simplify data ingestion and accelerate development with analytics and machine learning tools.

FHIR is the Health and Life Sciences (HLS) industry standard format for storing and exchanging healthcare data. FHIR is specified both as a data model for structuring real-world healthcare information, and as a RESTful API for exchange of healthcare data between Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems. By providing an industry-wide standard for the structure and exchange of health data, FHIR enables health data interoperability, allowing patients' Personal Health Information (PHI) to travel where it is needed.

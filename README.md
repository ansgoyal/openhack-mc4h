## Introduction
The goals of  **Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare** include: enabling interoperability using Azure for FHIR, driving advanced solutions with Machine Learning, Artificla Intillegence and Dynamics.  

Applications built on the Azure with FHIR can make use of Logic Apps, Connections IoMT, SMART on FHIR, Conversion and more.   

Applications built on the Dynamics platform (which includes Dynamics Model applications) or makes use of Dataverse can operate without needing to make REST API calls directly to Azure API for FHIR.  In addition to running Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare solutions, developers can also take advantage of the Dynamics' low-code/no-code environment to construct solutions/applications that can read & write healthcare related data to the Azure API for FHIR.
